# Facial Keypoint Detection
This repository contains a project that performs facial keypoint detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was trained on a dataset of facial images and their corresponding facial keypoints using PyTorch.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Facial Keypoints Detection dataset, which contains 7049 training images and 1783 test images. The dataset includes images with faces marked with 68 facial keypoints, such as the corners of the mouth and the eyes.

### Acknowledgments
- This project was inspired by the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program.
- The dataset used in this project was obtained from the Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection competition.
